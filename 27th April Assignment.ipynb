    "all data points in a single cluster and then recursively splits the cluster into smaller sub-clusters \n",
    "until each data point is in its own cluster.\n",

    "Density-based clustering: This type of clustering algorithm identifies clusters based on the density of data\n",

    "Limitations:\n",

    "Sensitive to the initial placement of centroids: K-means clustering is sensitive to the initial placement\n",
